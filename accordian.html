					<p>SimpleText is the native text editor for the Apple Macintosh OS in versions before OS X.
					SimpleText allows editing including text formatting (underline, italic, bold, etc.), fonts, and sizes. 
					It was developed to integrate the features included in the different versions of TeachText that were
					created by various software development groups within Apple.[2]

					It can be considered similar to Windows' WordPad application. In later versions it also gained additional
					read only display capabilities for PICT files, as well as other Mac OS built-in formats like Quickdraw GX 
					and QTIF, 3DMF and even QuickTime movies.SimpleText can even record short sound samples and, using Apple's
					PlainTalk speech system, read out text in English.</p>

					<p>Bootstrap makes use of certain HTML elements and CSS properties that require the use of the HTML5 doctype.
					Include it at the beginning of all your projects.With Bootstrap 2, we added optional mobile friendly styles for 
					key aspects of the framework. With Bootstrap 3, we've rewritten the project to be mobile friendly from the start. 
					Instead of adding on optional mobile styles, they're baked right into the core. In fact, Bootstrap is mobile first. 
					Mobile first styles can be found throughout the entire library instead of in separate files.
					
					You can disable zooming capabilities on mobile devices by adding user-scalable=no to the viewport meta tag. This
					disables zooming, meaning users are only able to scroll, and results in your site feeling a bit more like a native
					application.

					Some Bootstrap elements <span class="tab_arrows"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> <i class="fa fa-angle-up fa-2x hide" aria-hidden="true"></i></span>
				</div>
				<div class="tab_content">
					<p>Bootstrap sets basic global display, typography, and link styles. Specifically, we:
					Set background-color: #fff; on the body
					Use the @font-family-base, @font-size-base, and @line-height-base attributes as our typographic base
					Set the global link color via @link-color and apply link underlines only on :hover
					These styles can be found within scaffolding.less.
					Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house our grid system. You may choose
					one of two containers to use in your projects. Note that, due to padding and more, neither container is nestable.
					Use .container for a responsive fixed width container.</p>

					<p>Headers are fixed regions at the top of a screen that can contain a title label, and left/right buttons for
					navigation or to carry out various actions.Headers come in a variety of default color options:
					A secondary header bar can be placed below the original header bar. There are quite a few more ways to customize Headers.
					Have a look at Button Bars to get other ideas on how it could be used.The content area in Ionic is the scrollable viewport
					of your app. While your headers and footers will be fixed to the top and bottom, respectively, the content area will fill 
					the remaining available space.Footers have the same color options as the headers, just use bar-footer instead of bar-header.
					If a title is present in the footer, any buttons will automatically be placed on the correct side of the title in relation
					to how the markup was written, such as:</p>

					<p>Use a contact form to let readers get in touch without exposing your email address. You can also use a contact form for creating
					an RSVP form for an event by adding some dropdown or checkbox fields to the form.To add a contact form, go to My Sites and click on 
					Pages → Add. You can also add a Contact Form to existing Posts or Pages by editing them in the Visual Editor. In the toolbar, you’ll 
					see the @ symbol like in the example below:The contact form comes with four predefined fields: Name, Email, Website and Comment. 
					You’re free to edit, delete or add more fields to your form. Note that you can decide to make your field required or not.</p>
